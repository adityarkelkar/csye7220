# CSYE 7220 Midterm Project

## Deployment pipeline for AWS and Azure - Problem Statement
Write a CI/CD engine that spans Azure and AWS: It builds on one Cloud and deploys and runs on the other. You can pick the coding language, the Web site tech stack, and the CI/CD toolset. The Web site shall consist of a song lyrics Web site with at least one picture. You will demonstrate the following scenario to your TA: You will rebuild the Web site with the least amount of mouse and keyboard movement (caching the different Web pages is allowed). The rebuild will trigger a deployment and eventually lead to a new song lyric Web page when the browser is refreshed.
